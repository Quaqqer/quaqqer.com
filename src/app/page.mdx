Welcome to my personal website!
I'm a passionate software engineering student from Sweden.
My curiosities include algorithms, compilers, emulation and more.

My current projects are my own personal language,
[Saft](https://github.com/Quaqqer/saft), mostly as a programming exercise
rather than any particular actual use cases. I'm also writing my own NES
emulator, [Nemu](https://github.com/Quaqqer/nemu). Head over to my
[projects](/projects) if you are curious about my other projects!
