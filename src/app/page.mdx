Welcome to my personal website!
I'm a passionate software engineering student from Sweden.
My curiosities include algorithms, compilers, emulation and more.

The project I'm working on currently is my NES emulator,
[Nemu](https://github.com/Quaqqer/nemu). Previously I worked on my own
programming language, [Saft](https://github.com/Quaqqer/saft) that included a
bytecode compiler and bytecode VM. Head over to my [projects](/projects) if you
are curious about my other projects!
