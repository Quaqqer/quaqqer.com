export default ({ children }) => <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>;

Select a ROM and start playing! My personal favorite is Tetris. :)

CHIP-8 uses a 4x4 pad for controls, the tables below show how keys are mapped on
the keyboard. Since every game has different controls, you will have to discover
them for yourself.

<div className="flex flex-row items-center space-x-4 justify-center my-6 leading-none">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>C</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>D</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>E</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>F</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <div className="text-gray-300 text-3xl">â‡”</div>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

### Description

This is a basic CHIP-8 emulator implemented in JavaScript (or TypeScript
rather). I followed a [high-level guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/)
which was a good middle-ground between challenging and fun.
