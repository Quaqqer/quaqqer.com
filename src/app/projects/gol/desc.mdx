### Description

This is [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life),

complete and can simulate itself. The rules for Conways Game of Life are
very simple.

- A cell dies by isolation if it has fewer than two neighbours
- A cell dies by overpopulation if it has more than three neigbhours
- A dead cell comes to life if it has exactly three neighbours
