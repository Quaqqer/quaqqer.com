## Description

Nemu is my own
[NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) emulator
written in Rust.

Currently only [games running on mapper
0](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper0.html) are supported. Different game carts
have different internal wiring which must be emulated, at the moment I have
only implemented one type of cart. Some games that should run are Donkey Kong,
Super Mario Bros 1, and Ice Climber.
